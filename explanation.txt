YouTube Channel Analytics Project – Explanation
Project Overview

This project is a complete YouTube analytics system built using Python.
It fetches YouTube channel data using the YouTube Data API, stores it in a SQLite database, and displays analysis results through a Streamlit dashboard.

The project is modular and follows a clean data pipeline architecture.

Overall Data Flow

User → Streamlit UI / CLI → YouTube API → JSON Storage → SQLite Database → SQL Queries → Dashboard

Step-by-Step Working Flow
1. User Input (UI Layer)

The user enters a YouTube Channel ID.

In Web Mode → through app.py (Streamlit dashboard).

In CLI Mode → through main.py.

2. Database Setup

database.py creates a SQLite database file.

It creates three main tables:

channels

playlists

videos

Tables are created only if they do not already exist (safe and reusable).

3. Fetch Data from YouTube API

api.py connects to the YouTube Data API using the API key from config.py.

It fetches:

Channel details

Playlist details

All videos in playlists (handles pagination)

The data is cleaned and structured properly.

4. Save Raw Data Locally

storage.py saves the fetched data as a JSON file.

The file is stored inside the local_data folder.

This helps for:

Backup

Debugging

Reusing data without calling API again

5. Insert Data into Database

db_insert.py reads the JSON data.

It inserts the data into SQLite tables.

Uses safe SQL operations like:

INSERT OR REPLACE

Transactions for data consistency

6. Query for Analysis

db_queries.py contains SQL queries for analytics.

It provides:

Channel statistics

Top viewed videos

Upload trends

Filtering videos by date

7. Display Results (Dashboard)

app.py is the Streamlit dashboard.

It shows:

Channel metrics

Video performance

Upload trends

Date filters

The UI is interactive and user-friendly.

Files and Responsibilities

config.py → Stores API key and configuration.

api.py → Fetches data from YouTube.

storage.py → Saves raw JSON locally.

database.py → Creates SQLite database and tables.

db_insert.py → Inserts data into database.

db_queries.py → Performs SQL analysis.

main.py → CLI pipeline execution.

app.py → Streamlit web dashboard.

How to Run the Project
CLI Mode

Run:
python main.py

This will:

Fetch data

Save JSON

Insert into database

Streamlit Dashboard

Run:
streamlit run app.py

Then open the browser link (localhost:8501).

Key Strength of the Project

Modular design

Clear separation of responsibilities

Database normalization

Safe SQL operations

Interactive analytics dashboard

Scalable and easy to extend
